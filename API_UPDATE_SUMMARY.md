# API Configuration Update Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated API Base URL
- **File**: `src/config/apiConfig.js`
- **Change**: Updated the DEVELOPMENT base URL from `http://localhost:3001/` to `https://localhost:7777/`
- **Reason**: To connect to the new backend API endpoint

### 2. Updated User API Endpoints
- **File**: `src/config/apiConfig.js`
- **Changes**:
  - `LIST`: Changed from `/users` to `/gateway/users/get-all-user`
  - `CREATE`: Changed from `/users` to `/gateway/users/create`
  - `UPDATE`: Changed from `/users/{id}` to `/gateway/users/update/{id}`
  - `DELETE`: Changed from `/users/{id}` to `/gateway/users/delete/{id}`
  - `BASE`: Changed from `/users` to `/gateway/users`

### 3. Updated Environment Variables
- **File**: `.env.local`
- **Change**: Updated `VITE_API_URL` from `http://localhost:3001/api` to `https://localhost:7777/`

## API Endpoint Mapping

### Before:
```
GET /users                -> Get all users
POST /users              -> Create user
PUT /users/{id}          -> Update user
DELETE /users/{id}       -> Delete user
```

### After:
```
GET /gateway/users/get-all-user    -> Get all users
POST /gateway/users/create         -> Create user
PUT /gateway/users/update/{id}     -> Update user
DELETE /gateway/users/delete/{id}  -> Delete user
```

## Testing the Changes

1. **Start the development server**: Run `npm run dev` in the project root
2. **Navigate to the Users page**: Click on "User Management" in the sidebar
3. **Check API calls**: Open browser DevTools -> Network tab to see if the new API endpoints are being called
4. **Test functionality**: Try to:
   - View the user list (should call `/gateway/users/get-all-user`)
   - Add a new user
   - Edit an existing user
   - Delete a user

## Notes

- The API service (`src/services/api.js`) uses the updated endpoints automatically via the configuration
- All existing React components will continue to work without changes
- The RBAC context will use the new API endpoints for all user operations
- Other endpoints (roles, permissions, modules) remain unchanged but can be updated if needed

## SSL/HTTPS Considerations

Since the new backend uses HTTPS (`https://localhost:7777`), ensure:
1. The backend server has a valid SSL certificate
2. Your browser accepts the self-signed certificate if using one for development
3. CORS is properly configured on the backend to allow requests from your React app

## Next Steps

1. Test the application with the new API endpoints
2. Update role/permission/module endpoints if they have also changed
3. Implement authentication flow if required by the new backend
4. Add error handling for any new response formats from the backend
